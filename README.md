# GLSL Assignments

This repository contains a set of three **GLSL assignments** completed for the course **Computer Graphics** during my second year of university.

### About the Project

The objective of these assignments was to introduce **shaders** and **computer graphics** through **GLSL**. Each assignment focused on exploring different aspects of shader programming and understanding the basics of graphical computations.

### Features
- Three separate assignments exploring various concepts in GLSL.
- Introduction to shader programming.
- Basic understanding of computer graphics principles.

### Technologies
- **GLSL**
